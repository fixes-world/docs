# 🎟️ FIXeS Lottery

> Inspired by [https://www.powerball.com/](https://www.powerball.com/)

### Basic Concept

**Ticket：**&#x20;

You need to participate by purchasing a Lottery Ticket.

**Balls：**

Each ticket contains 5 white balls and 1 red ball. They are all numbers, and the range of numbers:

* White Balls: **1 \~ 33**
* Red Ball: <mark style="color:red;">**1 \~ 16**</mark>

When your tickets matches the winning result according to the rules, you will receive the corresponding prize.

**Prizes and Jackpot:**

The jackpot grows until it is won. Players win a prize by matching one of the 9 ways to win. The jackpot is won by matching all five white balls in any order and the red ball.&#x20;

**PowerUp:**

You can choose to pay more when buying lottery tickets as **PowerUp** to increase the multiplier after winning.&#x20;

Note: The Jackpot is not affected by Powerup and only depends on the current accumulated Jackpot and the number of Jackpot winners.

### Game Pools

Currently, two prize pools are available.

* ID: FIXES\_MINTING\_LOTTERY\_POOL
  * The Prize Token is **$FLOW**.
  * Each ticket price is **0.1352 $FLOW (**And also you can take **1 $FLOW** to purchase **1 Ticket** and **mint 4000 $fixes** before **$fixes** are minted out**)**
  * The lottery will be drawn automatically every three days.
* ID: FIXES\_BASIS\_LOTTERY\_POOL
  * The Prize Token is **$fixes**
  * Each ticket price is **2000 $fixes**
  * The lottery will be drawn automatically every three days.

Note: customized numbers choosing is still WIP, current the number of tickets are generated randomly when purchasing.

* The **Grant Prize** is at least **50%** of the current epoch's prize pool.&#x20;
* The remaining **50%** and the accumulated jackpot pool will be used to prioritize the payment of non-Jackpot prizes (Second \~ Sixth). The remaining prize money will all be included in the **Grant Prize**.
* If the total prize pool is too small, non-Jackpot prizes will decrease dynamically based on the balance of the total prize pool.
* The Prize of **Jackpot, Second, and Third** will be deducted by a certain _Service Fee_.
* The _Service Fee_ will be deposited into the platform's treasury pools.
